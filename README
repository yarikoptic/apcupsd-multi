ABOUT
-----

Following directory contains files destined to make it possible to run
multiple apcupsd instances using Debian's package of apcupsd (version
3.12.4-2 as of etch release, which is used on that server).


FILES
-----

 apcupsd.init -- init.d script (assumes assignAPC under /usr/local/sbin)

 assignAPC -- helper script to dynamically create deterministic
              assignment of APC units attached via USB
              (TODO: split so configuration is under /etc/default/apcupsd)

 apcaccess-multi -- very simple helper to query all APC available
              units

 apcupsd-usb1.conf -- sample configuration file for an USB attached APC
